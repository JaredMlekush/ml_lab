Prework
------

Before the start of class, please complete the following:

Required
------

- Create a [deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) account. Pratice using it. 

    You'll be collabrating frequently in notebooks, deepnotes works well for this.

- Try to install the conda environment. Instructions are [here](https://github.com/brianspiering/ml_lab/tree/main/resources).

    If it works, great! If does not work, that is okay because you can bring the installation issues to class.

Optional

- [You Canâ€™t Escape Hyperparameters and Latent Variables: Machine Learning as a Software Engineering Enterprise](https://nips.cc/virtual/2020/public/invited_16166.html) by Charles Isbell. (45 minutes)

    We are going to take a software engineering approach to machine learning. The focus will be on designing and implementing end-to-end systems. With that increased power, comes increased responsibility to make sure our systems are doing the "right" thing (broadly defined).
