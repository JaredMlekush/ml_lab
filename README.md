Course Description
----

In this course, you'll create end-to-end solutions to machine learning problems. This course will cover common applied techniques in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning, such as regression, classification, and clustering. You'll learn to how to properly engineer features, apply algorithms, and evaluate model performance. The focus of the course will be Python's [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) library.
